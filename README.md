ðŸ§  Tao Trader: Annotation-First Trading Journal

Tao Trader is a modular, annotation-first trading journal built with FastAPI and deployed via Railway. Itâ€™s designed for traders who value precision, context, and analyticsâ€”offering a clean interface for logging trades, attaching insights, and visualizing performance.

This project reflects my journey into trading, Python development, web deployment, and data integrity. Itâ€™s a hands-on showcase of my ability to learn fast, troubleshoot deeply, and build tools that solve real problems.

ðŸ”§ Features

    Trade Logging API â€“ Add, view, and delete trades with rich metadata (strategy, confidence, notes, etc.)

    Malware-Grade Backup Logic â€“ Atomic JSON writes, timestamped backups, and auto-recovery to prevent data loss

    Analytics Dashboard â€“ Live charting of win rate, loss rate, and average R-multiple using Matplotlib

    CSV Import â€“ Parse and group Tradovate exports into structured trade entries

    PDF & Excel Export â€“ Generate clean reports for review or sharing

    Image Attachments â€“ Upload annotated screenshots or charts per trade
