Journal To Do List

1. Add Read Endpoints (CRUD-ish)

Give yourself the ability to query what you’ve stored:

    List all trades

    Filter by date range, direction, profit/loss thresholds

    Paginate with limit/offset or cursors for large journals

    Fetch single trade by ID

This unlocks your API as a true journal backend.
2. Build Analytics Summaries

Expose performance metrics so you can track edge and expectancy over time:

    Total trades, wins vs losses, win rate

    Average R-multiple, max drawdown

    Time-based trends (daily/weekly/monthly PnL)

    Custom buckets (e.g., grouping by setup type once you add annotations)

A single /analytics endpoint can return all your key stats.
3. Wire Up Persistence Migrations

Replace the simple metadata.create_all with versioned migrations:

    Install and configure Alembic

    Generate your first revision (the trades table)

    Learn how to write upgrade/downgrade scripts

    Automate migrations on app startup or via CI

This keeps your schema in sync as you evolve.
4. In-App Backup & Restore

Turn on “instant rewind” for your journal:

    A POST /backup endpoint that dumps your DB into a timestamped file

    A GET /backups to list existing snapshots

    A POST /restore/{file} endpoint to roll back

Atomic, programmatic safety nets for your data.
5. Export Workflows

Surface your trades for reporting and annotation:

    CSV exports via a streaming endpoint

    PDF reports with charts/images (WeasyPrint or ReportLab)

    Embed your trade screenshots or entry/exit plots

Ideal for sharing a monthly recap, or running external analytics.
6. Front-End & CI/CD

You’ve got the API—now build a simple React or Vue dashboard:

    Fetch trades, plot R-multiple distributions with
